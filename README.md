Soil terms.

Assymbled in support of an older [Soil Reader](https://enviro-soil.com/soils101/) that was created as an examplar to Univeristy students of how an 'A' student might take notes for an upper division introductory soils course.

A latexstyle.css was applied. Then local style was altered to bold definition terms and change definitions to justify-left.
